                                        Accra, Ghana-In Nima, Mohammed Kudus commands god-like status. In the dense neighbourhood of
                                        Accra that he calls home, there is pride in the locals' voices when his name is mentioned.

                                        Fans of his club Ajax know him for scoring goals, dribbling, creating chances and occasionally
                                        pulling off a cheeky piece of skill on the football pitch.
                                    </p>
                                        <p>
                                            To the people of Nima though, he'll always be that innocent-looking, 
                                            scrawny kid who captivated them with his magical left foot at craggy Kawukudi Park for years.

                                            One episode from his time there with his boyhood club Strong Tower FC is fondly etched 
                                            in the minds of many of his hometown fans.
                                        </p>
                            <p>
                                During a high-profile friendly against Powerlines FC at junior level, an 11-year-old Kudus carried the
                                team on his shoulders, dominating the game and showing an innate precision rare in footballers his age.
                                In the end, he netted all six goals as Strong Tower drew 6-6 with their opponents.

                                To date, the memory of the young star outclassing his opponents on that day in 2011 remains an anecdote
                                held dear in these parts.
                            </p>                         
                                    <p>
                                        “I first saw Kudus play on the street, and I immediately saw a good player in him,” says Joshua Ayoba Awuah, 
                                        the manager of Strong Tower, who discovered Kudus and set him on a path to greatness.

                                        “I invited him to my training ground, and he was fantastic from day one,” Awuah said.
                                        “I named him worlds best. He was only 10 years when I met him, but his quality was clear.
