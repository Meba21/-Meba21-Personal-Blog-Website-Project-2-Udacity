                                The passengers on any airplanes above the stadium when Messi scored would've 
                                felt the turbulence caused not by the dirty air but the peacefulness of a late November evening destroyed with utter
                                disdain by Argentina fans celebrating a Messi goal in a must-win match.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The crowd had been loud all evening. But perhaps the fine margin between Argentina's 
                                survival and elimination kept the sound levels in check somewhat. Or maybe they were saving their voices for Messi's goal, certain that the 
                                maestro would deliver when it mattered and that it would all go according to plan.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Messi scored, and the stadium erupted. If sound waves could turn into flames,
                                pour scorn on everything around them-that by now was little bits of nothing-and 
                                leave them to burn before taking over the space left behind, that was the moment
                            </p>                            
                            <p>
                                In Brazil eight years ago, that 7-1 was in a semi-final. This year,
                                Argentina had been clinging on. The loss to Saudi Arabia not only
                                rattled them but left them humiliated-and facing an early World Cup exit. In a group match
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But Messi scored. And now Argentina were dreaming again: On the pitch, in the crowd, 
                                in Buenos Aires many thousands of kilometres away and in Rosario a couple of hours 
                                up the road where this little boy still lives in murals and memories of residents.
